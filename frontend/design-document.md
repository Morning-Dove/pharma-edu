# Design Document for Pharmacy Application

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a Pharmacy Application that allows pharmacy technician students to create and search for patients and doctors, enter prescriptions, and search for medications.

#### Background
Pharmacy Technician students need efficient systems to practice managing patient and doctor information, prescriptions, and medication searches. Existing solutions often lack integration and ease of use.

#### Context
This application aims to streamline the pharmacy workflow by providing a user-friendly interface and robust backend to manage key pharmacy operations.

#### Goals
- Allow creation and search of patient and doctor records.
- Enable entry and search for prescriptions.
- Facilitate medication searches.
- Ability to print prescription labels.

#### Non-Goals
- Inventory management is out of scope for this design.
- Billing and insurance processing are not covered in this document.

## Detailed Design 
### Architecture The application follows a client-server architecture with a React frontend

#### Frontend Components
The following React components will be used to build the frontend example images are supplied by the Pharmacy Technician Instructor Chris Richey at Dixie Technical College:

- **Home**: The landing page of the application.
Provides an overview and navigation to other pages.
![Home Page](wireframe-images/home.png)

- **NewRx**: Page for entering new prescriptions. Contains a form for prescription entry with fields for patient, doctor, medication, dosage, and instructions.
![Create Rx Page](wireframe-images/new-rx.png)

- **Patients**: Page for creating and searching patient records. Includes forms for adding new patients and a search interface for finding existing ones.

- **RxSearch**: Page for searching existing prescriptions. Allows users to search for prescriptions by medication or other criteria.
	- Will be similar in design to the previous images listed. Will need to have the ability to search by: brand name, strength (200mg,400mg,â€¦) , NDC (national drug code)

- **SigCode**: Page for searching medication information. Provides a search interface for medication information.
